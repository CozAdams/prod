    <!-- Overview Message -->
    <br>
    You may establish either an IRA with the Pension Fund of the Christian Church if you are:
    <ul>
        <li>an employee or former employee of an employer that is eligible to participate in the Defined Contribution Retirement Accounts of the Pension Fund of the Christ Church (Disciples of Christ) ("DCRA"); or</li>
        <li>the spouse of such eligible employee or former employee, if you file a joint tax return with the employee or former employee.</li>
    </ul>
    See <a href="https://pensionfund.org/uploads/Eligibility_for_IRA_Contributions.pdf">Eligibility for a Pension Fund Traditional IRA or Roth IRA</a> for information as to whether you are eligible to make regular contributions, rollover/transfer contributions, or both, to an IRA. You can make regular contributions to an IRA from your spouse's taxable compensation if you file a joint tax return with your spouse. If you are the spouse of an employee or former employee, you may only roll or transfer assets into the IRA from retirement plans or IRAs held in your name.
    <br><br>
    To open your IRA, please complete the below contribution information. A minimum of $100 is required to open your IRA but you can also select to do a monthly recurring contribution of a different amount.
    <br><br>
    Once your IRA is open, you may also choose to rollover or transfer funds from other financial institutions. If youâ€™d like to perform a rollover or transfer into your IRA, please contact Pension Fund and we will assist you in this process.
