                One of the great benefits to choosing Pension Fund of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) (“Pension Fund”) as your retirement provider is that unlike most other mainstream retirement providers, you can still claim a housing allowance in retirement. Because we are a church plan, Pension Fund’s Board of Directors is authorized to act on behalf of the church in designating a portion of your pension, annuity and/or Tax-Deferred Retirement Account (TDRA) payout as Housing Allowance.

            I am requesting that the Board of Directors of the Pension Fund of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) designate a portion of my TDRA and/or annuity payout as housing allowance and that these are accounts I hold with Pension Fund and are therefore eligible for housing allowance.
            I understand that the below designation for my TDRA and/or annuity will be in effect until I notify Pension Fund in writing that I wish to designate a different amount.

            <b>Please Note:</b> If you are receiving a Pension Plan retirement pension as well as a monthly payout from your TDRA, you must designate 100% of your housing allowance from your pension before making a designation of any remaining amount from your TDRA payout.
